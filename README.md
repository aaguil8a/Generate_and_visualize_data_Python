# What do Americans think about abortion?

# Description

There have been recent discussions on abortion rights within the United States for and against, given that I wanted to investigate: What do Americans think about abortion?


# Dataset

The data is from: data.world, which has five features and 63 observations—and there are no missing values in the data. The date set poll dates to range from 1975 Apr 4-7 to 2021 May 3-18—and each poll question is about Americans' support for abortion, but not in all cases.
