# What do Americans think about abortion?

# Description

There have been recent discussions on abortion rights within the United States for and against, given that I wanted to investigate: What do Americans think about abortion?


# Dataset

The data is from: data.world, which has five features and 63 observations—and there are no missing values in the data. The date set poll dates to range from 1975 Apr 4-7 to 2021 May 3-18—and each poll question is about Americans' support for abortion, but not in all cases.

# Plot

In the first plot, we can see that, for the most part, Americans support abortion in any circumstance about 25% of the time, and it does not drop below 20%, which could mean Americans hold a constant view about abortion being legal in any circumstance.

In the second plot, we see illegal in all circumstances, and it does not go higher than 22 percent. In general, there is a constant view about abortion—being illegal in all circumstances.

In the third plot, we see that most Americans, meaning above 48%, think that abortion should be supported only under certain circumstances: we see here that the graph tends to capture: a general attitude about abortion.

In the last plot, we see a small percentage of Americans have no opinion on abortion, which is also decreasing.

# In Sum

In summary, we see those opposites: legal in any circumstance and illegal in all circumstances tend to be constant attitudes within year range. But we see that is not the general attitude; rather, it seems to be that Americans support abortion only under certain circumstances. And lastly, we see that a small percentage have no opinion on abortion.
